This is the infrastructure for the branch prediction competition.
This infrastructure was updated on September 14, 2006 to remove extraneous
traces and include the compression engine used to pre-process the traces.

See doc/index.html for "complete" documentation.

Updated files are my_predictor.h, and a utils.h file added for utilities.
